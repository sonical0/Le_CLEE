CLEE Bordeaux Theme (auto-converted)

Installation:
1) Copy this folder to: wp-content/themes/clee-bordeaux-theme
2) Activate the theme in WordPress admin.
3) Create pages with the following slugs to match templates:
   - agenda
   - bureau-membres
   - companies
   - contact
   - documents-officiels
   - establishments
   - jeunes-familles
   - le-clee
   - nos-actions
   - orientation-insertion
   - pfmp
   - vie-clee-eleves
   - vie-clee

4) Set a static homepage and choose the page that uses the front page (or keep is_front_page()).

Notes:
- CSS/JS are enqueued via functions.php (globals/common always + page-specific).
- Internal links .html were converted to WordPress URLs based on these slugs.
